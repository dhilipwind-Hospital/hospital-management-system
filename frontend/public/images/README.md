# Images Folder

Put public images for the frontend here. Paths are relative to the site root at runtime.

Examples:
- Login illustration expected at: `/images/login-illustration.png`

Notes:
- Files in `public/` are served as static assets. Avoid large files in Git. 
- Preferred formats: optimized PNG or SVG for illustrations, WebP/JPEG for photos.
- Keep file sizes small for faster page loads.
